## About Me
I'm a passionate and curious computer science and engineering student, constantly exploring new technologies and tinkering with code. I believe in the power of programming to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact on people's lives. When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me participating in robotics competitions, mentoring aspiring programmers, and engaging in thrilling track and field events.

## Projects I'm Proud Of
- **SmartPlate** üçΩÔ∏è: A web app that generates personalized meal plans for college students based on their food preferences, budget, and dietary needs. Built with React, Node.js, and a pinch of Firebase magic. It's like having a virtual chef!
- **Discord Schedule-Finder Chatbot** ü§ñ: Developed a handy chatbot for high school students to instantly retrieve their class schedules and determine whether they're attending in-person or remotely. No more scrambling for printed timetables!
- **First Robotics Team 250 Scouting Software** ü§ñ: Led the development of scouting software that provided real-time match reports for our robotics team. By crunching data and utilizing C#, SQL Server, and Agile tools, we strategized our way to the international finals!

## Coding Adventures
I love to explore different programming languages and frameworks. You'll find a mix of projects here, ranging from Python data analysis to Java robot controls. Feel free to dive in, experiment, and get inspired!
